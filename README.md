AJAX in WordPress Without Frameworks

This script is for developers like myself that do not want to load some monolithic framework just so they can do a bit of AJAX.

See the readme.txt file for information on usage

This is an adaptation of an AJAX script that I have been using and updating since around 2007. I like my scripts small and to the point. Hopefully others will find it useful.

I am open to suggestions for improvement of this plugin. Submit a support request.
